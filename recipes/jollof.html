    <h2>Description</h2>
   
    <p>To prepare a scrumptious jollof rice for four servings, you will need the following ingredients: 2 cups of long-grain parboiled rice, 1 cup of diced tomatoes, 1 cup of diced onions, 1 cup of diced bell peppers (a mix of red, green, and yellow), 3 cloves of minced garlic, 2 tablespoons of tomato paste, 1/4 cup of vegetable oil, 2 cups of chicken or vegetable broth, 1 teaspoon of ground cayenne pepper (adjust to taste), 1 teaspoon of paprika, 1 teaspoon of ground cumin, 1 teaspoon of thyme, 1 bay leaf, and salt and black pepper to taste. Before starting the cooking process, ensure to rinse the rice thoroughly to remove excess starch. In a large pot or skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat, then sauté the diced onions and bell peppers until they soften.</p>
   
    <p>Add the minced garlic and continue cooking for another minute until the fragrance fills the air. Next, stir in the tomato paste, diced tomatoes, and the assortment of spices, allowing the flavors to meld together for about 5 minutes. Finally, add the washed rice to the pot, coating it evenly with the tomato-based sauce. Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth, bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let the jollof rice simmer until the rice is tender and has absorbed all the delicious flavors. Serve the steaming jollof rice with your favorite protein or enjoy it as a satisfying vegetarian meal on its own.</p>
