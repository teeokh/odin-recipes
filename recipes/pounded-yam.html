    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Pounded yam is a traditional African dish that hails from Nigeria and some other West African countries. It is a popular and well-loved staple food in the region. The dish is made from yam, a starchy tuberous root vegetable that is cooked, pounded, and molded into a smooth, stretchy, and dough-like consistency. Pounded yam is known for its smooth texture and subtle, slightly sweet taste, making it a versatile accompaniment to a wide variety of soups and stews.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Yam</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Mortar and Pestle</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Peel and Cut the Yam: Start by peeling the yam with a knife to remove the skin. Then, cut the yam into evenly sized chunks. This will help ensure even cooking</li>
        <li>Boil the Yam: In a large pot, add enough water to cover the yam chunks. Bring the water to a boil and carefully add the yam pieces. Allow the yam to cook until it becomes soft and tender. You can test the doneness by inserting a fork or knife into the yam; it should easily slide through when it's fully cooked.</li>
        <li>Drain the Water: Once the yam is fully cooked, drain the water from the pot, leaving only the cooked yam.</li>
        <li>Serve and Enjoy</li>
    </ol>
